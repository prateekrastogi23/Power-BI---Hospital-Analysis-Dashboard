# Power-BI---Hospital-Analysis-Dashboard

1. Project Title-
Hospital Performance Dashboard:
A dynamic, role-based Power BI dashboard designed to streamline and visualize critical operations of a hospital—including patient care, doctor performance, medicine inventory, finance, and hospital-wide KPIs.

2. Purpose-
Hospital Analytics Dashboard is a modern, interactive Power BI solution that delivers operational visibility and role-specific insights across hospital departments. This dashboard enables secure, tailored views for doctors, patients, finance officers, and administrators using Row-Level Security (RLS). The dashboard is built to support data-driven healthcare decisions, improve resource management, and enhance patient care quality.

3. Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
• 📊 Power BI Desktop – For building interactive visual dashboards and report pages.
• 📂 Power Query – Used to clean, transform, and shape data before loading it into the model.
• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For creating calculated columns, measures, and implementing dynamic user-specific logic.
• 📝 Data Modeling – Designed using a star schema with well-defined relationships across tables like patients, doctors, appointments, finance, and medicine stock.
• 🔐 Row-Level Security (RLS) – Enables secure, role-specific data access so users see only relevant information.
• 🗃️ SQL (Structured Query Language) – Used to extract and query hospital data from the relational database before importing it into Power BI.
• 📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

4. Data Source
Source: Simulated and anonymized hospital data collected from Kaggle and curated to represent real-world healthcare operations and domains.
This dataset was originally sourced from Kaggle and enriched to include key entities across a typical hospital management system.

Data Tables Included:
Patients – Demographic details, assigned doctors, diagnosis records, and treatment plans.
Doctors – Doctor names, departments, consultation counts, earnings, and number of patients handled.
Appointments – Scheduling data including doctor-patient linkage, visit dates, status (attended/cancelled), and purpose of visit.
Medicine Stock – Details on available inventory, supplier names, medicine categories, stock quantities, and purchase costs.
Finance – Billing amounts, service charges, total revenue, and monthly financial trends.
Surgeries – Surgery types, departments, and distribution across different patient age groups.

5. Features
Business Problem:
Hospitals often struggle with managing diverse operational data scattered across departments—leading to inefficiencies in decision-making, reporting delays, lack of personalized insights, and data privacy issues. Key stakeholders (e.g., doctors, patients, finance staff) need tailored access, yet traditional systems offer one-size-fits-all reports.

Goal of the Dashboard:
To build a secure, role-specific, interactive dashboard that:
Gives doctors access to only their patients and performance metrics.
Lets patients view only their data.
Provides the finance team with full visibility into billing, charges, and inventory.
Equips hospital management with a unified view of KPIs, resource allocation, and performance trends.
